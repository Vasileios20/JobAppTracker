## Because your job hunt shouldn't feel like searching for a needle in a digital haystack!

Welcome to Git Hired, your new best friend in the job application jungle. Born in the crucible of the Elevate Hackathon, Git Hired is here to turn your job search from a chaotic mess into a well-oiled machine. (We can't guarantee you'll get hired, but at least you'll know where you applied!)

## Features

- **Application Tracking**: Keep tabs on your job applications like a pro stalker (but legal and for your own stuff).
- **Dashboard View**: Get a bird's eye view of your job hunt. It's like Google Maps, but for your career!
- **Search and Filter**: Find that one application faster than you can say "I'm perfect for this job!"
- **Status Updates**: From "Applied" to "Hired" (or "They ghosted me"), track it all.
- **Notes and Comments**: For when you need to remember that the interviewer had a cat named "Mr. Whiskers" (it might be important, you never know).
- **Analytics**: Impress your friends with fancy graphs about your job search. Who said unemployment can't be fun?
