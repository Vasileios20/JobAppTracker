## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) Design

This ERD outlines the database schema for the Git Hired application. It includes three main models: Job, Goal, and Note, each associated with the User model.

Job: Represents job applications, including details such as the category, company, title, location, application status, and the date applied.
Goal: Tracks user-defined career goals.
Note: Allows users to add notes related to specific job applications, with timestamps for creation and updates.

The relationships between the models are defined as follows:

A User can have multiple Jobs and Goals.
Each Job can have multiple associated Notes.
